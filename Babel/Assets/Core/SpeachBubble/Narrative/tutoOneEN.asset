    NarrativeSpeech: This is the Create Sign Screen. Create a unique Sign for Call
      Over. This Sign will make the girl come to your position, and is used for the
      rest of the game, so choose wisely. You can make a Sign from 2-3 Syllables (right
      side). When you are done designing the Sign, tap the button!
